# Cheesy Cheese Bakery Front-End Portfolio

Cheesy Cheese Bakery is a fictional website bakery that is made for final project in Course-Net Web Design course. In the website, user can see Home, About Us, Products, and Contact page. Besides, user can also register, log in, and log out from the websites. The difference is before user register and log in, navbar section only contains four links, Home, About Us, Products, and Contact. However, after user log in to the website, navbar section will show user's name, therefore there will have one addition link besides Contact links.

- HTML/CSS: Front-End basic development.
- Bootstrap: CSS framework to make the design is more interactive.
- Animate On Scroll (AOS): Library for making animation while scrolling the website.
